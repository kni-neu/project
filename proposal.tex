Your assignment for this week will be to send us a 2-page project proposal. You can choose the format you want to use, but make sure to include the following information to your document:


\begin{enumerate}
    \item What problem are you going to be tackling on your project?
    \item Why is that an interesting/useful application of data science?
    \item What data and models are you envisioning training to address that (e.g., classification,regression, clustering)?
    \item What will a user interface that packages your model(s) look like and how will you make it user-friendly for someone to leverage your work?
\end{enumerate}

To complete your submission, create your project's repository in your own Github namespace, and upload your provide your URL in Gradescope. For example, my Git handle is \verb"kni-neu", and my project repository would be:

\begin{verbatim}
    https://github.com/kni-neu/<project-name>
\end{verbatim}
